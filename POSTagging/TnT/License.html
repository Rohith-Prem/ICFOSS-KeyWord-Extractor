TnT, the short form of Trigrams'n'Tags, is a very efficient
statistical part-of-speech tagger that is trainable on different
languages and virtually any tagset. The component for parameter
generation trains on tagged corpora. The system incorporates several
methods of smoothing and of handling unknown words.
<P>
TnT consists of four modules: parameter generation (<tt> tnt-para</tt>),
the tagger (<tt> tnt</tt>), comparison of original and tagged
files (<tt> tnt-diff</tt>), and token/type/tag counting (<tt> tnt-wc</tt>). Two
pre-compiled language models are supplied, one for German and one for
English.
<P>
The work on TnT was made possible by support of Hans Uszkoreit at
the department of Computational Linguistics, Saarland University, and
by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in the
Graduiertenkolleg Kognitionswissenschaft Saarbrücken.
<P>
The German language model that is delivered with TnT is generated from
the NEGRA corpus. This corpus was part-of-speech tagged and manually
corrected at the Saarland University, Computational Linguistics,
Saarbrücken, and University Stuttgart, Institut für maschinelle
Sprachverarbeitung. It was also syntactically (structurally) annotated
in Saarbrücken.
<P>
The English language model that is delivered with TnT is generated from
the Susanne corpus. This corpus was published by Geoffrey Sampson and
is described in his book <em> English for the Computer</em>, Clarendon
Press, Oxford, 1995.
